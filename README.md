## Introduction

The challenge of NSF (Non-Sufficient Funds) checks has become a concern for individuals and businesses in the financial landscape. Issuing a check without enough funds can lead to complex financial problems and inconvenience. NSFShield addresses this issue with an innovative solution that transforms the way we handle check transactions.

NSFShield's solution is based on a two-step process. First, users employ the document scanner. It generates focused check images automatically. Following this, a meticulous check verification takes place. Users can swiftly and securely block a specific amount in their bank accounts, but only if sufficient funds are available. This ensures that the necessary funds are reserved, minimizing the risk of writing checks without proper financial backing.

## App Structure

NSFShield's architecture is thoughtfully designed to support its mission of efficient check management. The app follows the MVVM pattern, guided by Clean Architecture principles. This ensures a clear separation of concerns and facilitates smooth codebase management. BLoC state management enhances the app's reactivity and responsiveness.
